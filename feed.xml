In many publications on the Internet, you can find posts that there is little use from our metrics of user activity at different time intervals - on MAU, DAU, WAU. This is due to the fact that this “user activity” may not mean real user interest in our product. The growth of these metrics may be artificial and not reflect long-term engagement. This is due to the fact that there are various ways to attract a user (promotional promotions, bots, forced subscription, etc.). Here comes the second important question - how many users remain? This can be found out using the retention rate indicator.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Data Analysis in Business Part 1</title><link href="https://zmey56.github.io/blog//data%20analysis/mysql/superset/bi/2022/08/03/A-Data-Analysis-business-Part-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Data Analysis in Business Part 1" /><published>2022-08-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://zmey56.github.io/blog//data%20analysis/mysql/superset/bi/2022/08/03/A-Data-Analysis-business-Part-1</id><author><name></name></author><category term="data analysis" /><category term="mysql" /><category term="superset" /><category term="BI" /><summary type="html">I worked for a long time in large enterprises, in medicine and science in the roles of Data Analyst and Data Science. In February I had to leave the country I was living in, and I started looking for jobs as a Data Analyst or Data Science in various companies. But I faced the problem that even after completing test tasks, I was rejected with the wording that I had no commercial experience. After that I decided to take an internship - courses to understand the difference between the statistics I used and the ones used by other companies. It turned out that there were no differences. But I decided to share with you my projects, which I performed on these courses-internship. Maybe they will help someone not to get confused and understand where to start in the new place of work.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Using CatBoost and XGBoost to analyze the gameplay</title><link href="https://zmey56.github.io/blog//datascience/catboost/xgboost/job/2022/07/20/using-catboost-xgboost-analyze-gameplay.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Using CatBoost and XGBoost to analyze the gameplay" /><published>2022-07-20T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-07-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://zmey56.github.io/blog//datascience/catboost/xgboost/job/2022/07/20/using-catboost-xgboost-analyze-gameplay</id><author><name>Zmey56</name></author><category term="DataScience" /><category term="CatBoost" /><category term="XGBoost" /><category term="job" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">AB - testing the introduction of new technologies into the game.</title><link href="https://zmey56.github.io/blog//dataanalytics/abtest/job/2022/06/30/analyze-AB-test.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AB - testing the introduction of new technologies into the game." /><published>2022-06-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://zmey56.github.io/blog//dataanalytics/abtest/job/2022/06/30/analyze-AB-test</id><author><name>Zmey56</name></author><category term="DataAnalytics" /><category term="ABtest" /><category term="job" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Standard market methods for optimizing the cryptocurrency portfolio.</title><link href="https://zmey56.github.io/blog//cryptocurrency/portfolio/2022/05/11/portfolios-cryptocurrency.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Standard market methods for optimizing the cryptocurrency portfolio." /><published>2022-05-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-05-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://zmey56.github.io/blog//cryptocurrency/portfolio/2022/05/11/portfolios-cryptocurrency</id><author><name>Zmey56</name></author><category term="cryptocurrency" /><category term="portfolio" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
