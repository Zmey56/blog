To build such methods, we use mathematical statistics, numerical methods, optimization methods, probability theory, graph theory, and various techniques for working with data in digital form.\n\nUsually, machine learning algorithms can be classified into the following categories: learning with a teacher and learning without a teacher. Here is their definition from one of the sites:\n\nSupervised learning is one of the sections of machine learning dedicated to solving the following problem. There is a set of objects (situations) and the set of possible answers (responses, reactions). There is some relationship between responses and objects, but it is unknown. Only a finite set of use cases is known — the \"object, response\" pairs, called the training sample. Based on this data, you need to restore the dependency, that is, build an algorithm that can give a fairly accurate answer for any object. To measure the accuracy of responses, a quality functional is introduced in a certain way. see the Links)\n\nUnsupervised learning is one of the sections of machine learning. Studies a wide class of data processing problems in which only descriptions of a set of objects (training sample) are known, and it is required to detect internal relationships, dependencies, and patterns that exist between objects. Learning without a teacher is often contrasted with learning with a teacher, when each training object is given a \"correct answer\", and you need to find the relationship between the objects and the answers. see links)\n\nThe following machine learning methods will be discussed later:\n\n* Cluster analysis\n* Linear regression\n* Random forest\n\nUsing these algorithms, you can evaluate overvalued or undervalued stocks relative to the price of gold and possible movement on the next day. I remind you that you must be very careful and use the conclusions from this post at your own risk. I also remind you that my main goal is to show the potential of machine learning for stock valuation."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.1.

The main idea is to use a large ensemble of decision trees, each of which in itself gives a very low quality of classification, but due to their large number, the result is good.\n\nThe random forest algorithm accepts more than one variable in the input data to predict the output data. It works very efficiently on large amounts of data, can handle many input variables, has efficient methods for estimating missing data, and many other advantages. The main disadvantages are:\n1. Random forests is slow to generate forecasts because it has many decision trees. Whenever it makes a forecast, all the trees in the forest must make a forecast for the same given input and then vote on it. This whole process takes a long time.\n2. the Model is difficult to interpret compared to the decision tree, where you can easily make a decision by following the path in the tree.\n\nOne of the great advantages of a random forest is that it can be used for both classification and regression problems, which make up most of today's machine learning systems. I will talk about random forests in classification, since classification is sometimes considered a building block of machine learning. Below you can see what a random forest with two trees looks like:\n\nIn addition to the gold price, we will use other variables to forecast the Newmont Goldcorp share price. This will be the share prices of other foreign gold mining companies. I know it doesn't make a lot of sense, but we just want to see how to build this type of model.
